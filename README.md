# Dnd5_TreasureGeneratorApp
Application that generate treasures for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.

This my biggest app so far, i've learned a lot while building it. Kinda proud of it, even if it is still humble. I'm making progress and it is good to witness it. :)

# What i've learned 
- How to structure well my code, how to divide it properly into classes.
- Picking the right name for my variables, methodes and properties as well for the classes' names.
  * A good name should be self explanatory but the difficulty here is to not make it to long. Finding the right balance between those two       is key to have a code easy to read and understant.
- I learned that i had to create "tools" to help me during my coding process. I'm talking about the "CodeWriter" methode from the       "Table_Manager" class that write the lines of code needed to build the content of the divers treasurs tables.
- I learned how to comment my code to guide others to understand it as well as myself in the futur. :)

# Nota Bene:
Every class is documented and explain in the code. I'll post later an explanation of how i organised and subdivised the app into class. ^^
