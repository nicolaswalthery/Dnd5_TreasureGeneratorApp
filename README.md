# Dnd5_TreasureGeneratorApp
Application that generate treasures for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.

This my biggest app so far, i learned a lot while building it. 
# What i've learned 
- How to structure well my code, how to divide it properly into classes.
- Picking the right name for my variables, methodes and properties as well for the classes' names.
  * A good name should be self explanatory but the difficulty here is to not make it to long. Finding the right balance between those two       is key to have a code easy to read and understant.
- I learned that i had to create "tools" to help me during my coding process. I'm talking about the methode "CodeWriter" in the class "Table

Every class is documented and explain in the code. I'll post later an explanation of how i organised and subdivised the app into class. ^^
